```bash
npm install
```

## Running Tests

You can run Cypress tests locally using the following commands:

### Run Cypress Tests in Production Mode

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```

This command runs the Cypress tests in production mode multiple times, as specified in the `package.json` script.

### Open Cypress Test Runner

```bash

## Environment Variables

You can configure environment variables in `cypress.config.js` or by setting them in your terminal:

```javascript
// cypress.config.js
module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'http://192.168.1.201:8085'
  }
};
```

Or pass environment variables via CLI:

```bash
"npx cypress open --env ENV=production"
```

## Reporting

This project uses **Mochawesome** for generating HTML test reports.

### Generate and Open a Report

1. Run the tests to generate the report:

   ```bash
   npm run cypress:run
   ```

2. Open the Mochawesome report:

   ```bash
   npm run open:report
   ```

After running tests, reports will be generated in the `mochawesome-report` directory.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Website not reachable**:
   - Ensure the local website is running at `http://192.168.1.201:8085/`.
   - Check your network settings and firewall.

2. **Cypress command not found**:
   - Make sure dependencies are installed with `npm install`.

3. **Inconsistent test failures**:
   - Increase `defaultCommandTimeout` in `cypress.config.js` if the website is slow to respond.
